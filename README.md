RFCDE
===

This repository provides an implementation of random forests designed
for conditional density estimation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05753).
R and python packages are available. For installation details and
package-specific documentation see the subdirectories _r_ and
_python_. Both languages use a common C++ library which can be found
in the _cpp_ subdirectory.
