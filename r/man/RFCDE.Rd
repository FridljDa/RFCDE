\title{Fits a conditional density estimate random forest to training data.}
\usage{
RFCDE(x_train, z_train, n_trees = 1000, mtry = sqrt(ncol(x_train)),
  node_size = 5, n_basis = 31, basis_system = "cosine",
  min_loss_delta = 0, fit_oob = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_train}{a matrix of training covariates.}

\item{z_train}{a matrix of training responses.}

\item{n_trees}{the number of trees in the forest. Defaults to 1000.}

\item{mtry}{the number of candidate variables to try for each
split. Defaults to the square root of the number of covariates.}

\item{node_size}{the minimum number of observations in a leaf node.
Defaults to 5.}

\item{n_basis}{the number of basis functions used in split density
estimates. Defaults to 31.}

\item{basis_system}{the system of basis functions to use; currently
"cosine" and "Haar" are supported. Defaults to "cosine"}

\item{min_loss_delta}{the minimum loss for a split. Defaults to 0.0.}

\item{fit_oob}{whether to fit out-of-bag samples or not. Out-of-bag
samples increase the computation time but allows for estimation
of the prediction loss. Defaults to FALSE.}
